# Changelog

All notable changes to `ubuntu-prep-setup.sh` are tracked here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow
[SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`llama-reconfigure.sh`** — standalone, menu-driven editor for an
  installed `llama-server.service`. Parses the existing `ExecStart`
  in-place (preserves hand edits), lets the user change any of:
  model (HF slug `org/repo:file.gguf` or local path), context size,
  `-ngl`, KV cache quant, `--flash-attn`, listen host/port, `--mlock`,
  `--fit` / `--fit-ctx`, or raw args. On apply: downloads the new
  model (blocking, with curl progress bar), snapshots the current unit
  to `.bak`, writes the new unit, `daemon-reload`, restart, polls
  `is-active` for 10s, tails `journalctl` on failure, and offers
  `--rollback`. Flags (`--model`, `--context`, …) jump straight into
  specific editors for scripting. Does NOT modify `ubuntu-prep-setup.sh`
  — install `llama-reconfigure` independently once the base installer
  has set up llama.cpp.
- 15 new bats tests pinning the parser, serializer, round-trip, and
  the single-quote validator (total: 235).

## [1.0.1] — 2026-04-19

Second-pass code review hardening. All 15 findings from an independent review
of the 6,000-line installer were applied. No behavioural changes to the golden
path — every fix is defence-in-depth against malformed inputs or unusual host
state.

### Added
- `UBUNTU_PREP_VERSION` constant and `--version` / `-V` flag so users can tell
  which release they are running.
- Release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): tag-triggered, runs
  `shellcheck --severity=warning` + the full bats suite, verifies the tag
  matches `UBUNTU_PREP_VERSION`, then attaches `ubuntu-prep-setup.sh` and a
  `SHA256SUMS` file to a GitHub Release built from the matching CHANGELOG
  entry. Users can now download a pinned, checksum-verified copy.

### Security
- **HuggingFace download** now passes `HF_TOKEN` via `env` + positional args
  to `bash -c` so a malicious token, repo slug, or filename can't inject shell
  metacharacters into the curl invocation.
- **`.env.secrets` writer** escapes `\ " $ \`` in user-supplied values before
  emitting `export NAME="VALUE"`, so a secret containing `"` can't break the
  file when it's later sourced.
- **NVIDIA/OLLAMA secret reads** use the same positional-arg pattern rather
  than interpolating `$TARGET_USER_HOME` into a `bash -c "…"` body.
- **`OLLAMA_ORIGINS`** is rejected (and falls back to `*`) if it contains `"`
  or a newline, so a malformed value can't corrupt the systemd override file.
- **Driver `.run`, cuDNN `.deb`, and cuda-keyring `.deb`** are staged in
  `mktemp -d` directories instead of predictable `/tmp/<name>` paths that a
  local attacker could pre-create as a symlink.
- **`TARGET_USER`** is validated against `^[a-z_][a-z0-9_-]{0,31}$` in both
  the "current user" and "new user" branches, before any sudo/systemd path
  interpolates it.
- **`TARGET_USER_HOME`** is resolved with `getent passwd` rather than
  `eval echo "~$TARGET_USER"`, eliminating the second shell pass.
- **llama-server systemd `ExecStart`** validates that `hf_args` and
  `llama_host_args` contain no single quote before the unit file is written
  (the `bash -c '…'` body would otherwise break).

### Fixed
- **OpenClaw provider auto-config** — jq filter corrected from `.providers`
  to `.models.providers` to match the actual schema.
- **Resume state round-trip** — every value persisted to
  `/var/lib/ubuntu-prep/resume.env` is shell-quoted via `printf %q`, so
  pathological values with spaces, quotes, backslashes, or `$` survive a
  `source`-back intact. Bare `NAME="$VAL"` interpolation broke on any `"`.
- **`ENABLE_UFW_AUTOMATICALLY`** is now persisted and restored across the
  post-reboot resume (was previously lost).
- **Gated/missing HuggingFace repos** are now detected by HTTP status
  (401/403/404) and produce an actionable message instead of the generic
  "llama.cpp will download on first start" fallback.
- **`openclaw onboard`** exit code is captured and surfaced when the config
  file write fails, instead of being swallowed by `|| true`.

### Changed
- Extracted `nvm_env_prelude()` helper; eight copies of the
  `export NVM_DIR=…; source "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"` literal now share one
  implementation.
- `--local-mirror` help text documents the trust-on-first-use model —
  `StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new` means the first run trusts whatever
  host answers at that address.

### CI
- `check-nvidia-driver` workflow: replaced the single brittle grep with a
  fallback loop of four patterns (covers both the old and current
  nvidia.com page structures); pinned version `595.58.03` now matches the
  latest production release.
- All three scheduled workflows (`check-nvidia-driver`, `check-install-urls`,
  `check-openclaw`) now idempotently `gh label create … || true` before
  `gh issue create`, so a missing label no longer fails the job with
  exit 1.

### Earlier in-session fixes (pre-review)
- `CUDNN_VERSION` sanitised (`${var//[^0-9.]/}`) before interpolation into
  the download URL and keyring-copy path.
- cuDNN keyring copy wrapped in `sudo bash -c` so the glob expands as root;
  `wait_for_apt_lock` calls added around `dpkg -i` and `apt-get update`.
- TinyStories (`choice 5`) now starts with a minimal flag set to avoid a
  SEGV seen with production flags on the 656K model.
- LibreChat install falls back to GitHub when a `--local-mirror` clone fails.
- Added two bats tests pinning the exact `build_llama_hf_args` output for
  TinyStories (total: 220 tests).

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-17
